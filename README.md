# parafocus - text reader that puts the focus on each paragraph

This is an angular.js app for jumping between paragraphs using the keyboard. Besides navigating between paragraphs it can show paragraphs before or after the current paragraph without leaving the page. This could help if the reader needs to recall a detail from the last paragraph in order to fully understand the current paragraph.

I used these resources to help me get it done:

* [How to listen for key presses with AngularJS](http://www.eriky.com/2013/10/how-to-listen-for-key-presses-with-angularjs) – showed me that I wanted was keydown events on the body tag using ng-keydown
* [5apps](http://5apps.com/) – a lot like GitHub pages with Jekyll turned off, except I don’t need to create another branch. Unlike Heroku, free apps don’t go to sleep.
